This is a school project.
In this project, we developed a social networking Android application providing easy and real-time communication with nearby people. 

To tackle the Internet connectivity problem, the lower level protocol used is the delay tolerant network (DTN). It supports the traffic without the presence of the Internet and provides multiple connection mechanism. To reduce the power consumption, we change the update strategy as on demand update. It decrease the power consumption compared tothe periodic updates.

Please seek approval before using the DTN library in this project @http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kartiks/nusdtn/
